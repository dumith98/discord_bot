# discord_bot Jarbas

## Reminder
The bot access your guild (discord server) through a `.env` file in the same directory as the bot itself.
The file structure follows this template:
```# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN={your-bot-token}
DISCORD_GUILD={your-guild-name}
```
remember to add it to your `.gitignore` file so you don't push confidential information into your public repo.
